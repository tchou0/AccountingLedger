# Quick Project summary:

### In my project I created 3 classes
### 1. First is the Home class:
Inside this class, the main method will show the main menu which will give the user all the options to go to different screens and do different things.

For example: 
- Add Deposit 
- Make a Payment 
- Ledger
-  Exit

For Deposit and Payment method, we will ask the user for the debit information and save it to the csv file.

### 2. Then we have the Ledger class:

This will show all the entries thatâ€™s already in the csv file.

I will have another menu for ledger showing all the Entries, Deposits, Payments, and reports.

### 3. And last is Transaction class:

This class is where I create my getters and my constructors, so I can use them in the other classes.

#### One interesting piece of code from my project:

         // for (Transaction item : transactions)

The for each loop is interesting because it helps me get all the data from the Transaction class fast
